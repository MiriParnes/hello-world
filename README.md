# hello-world
Hi my name is miriam. i am a buding junior data analyst looking to seek new opourtunities and discover and learn new ideas to help me grow as a data analyst.
This is my first repository so I am experimenting with Github and learning the workings and kinks. 
I live in NYC and am currently seeking a new job as an entry level data analyst.
I took the Google Coursera Course and fully completed it with my very own case study that is now published on kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/miriamparnes/bellabeat-case-study-for-data-analysis
My hobbies include adranaline filled adventures such as skydiving, rock climbing, skateboarding and skiing. I love animals especially dogs and horses. My fav food...well drink really of all time is a good solid cup of coffee.
